CORRELATION

The correlation coefficient indicates the strength and direction of the statistical relationship between two variables. The coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with a value of 0.43 signifying a positive but moderately strong relationship between the two variables.

A positive correlation coefficient means that the variables increase together. Therefore, as one variable increases, the other also tends to increase, and vice versa.
The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1, the stronger the positive relationship.
A correlation coefficient of 0.43 is not very high, but it indicates a moderately positive relationship.
If the correlation coefficient were negative, it would suggest that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases.
A correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship.
Thus, a correlation coefficient of 0.43 might suggest that, for example, as Pok√©mon's Attack values increase, their Defense values tend to increase as well, but the relationship is not very strong.
